RECOMMENDATION




Based on the analysis,  These are my recommendations.

E-wallets are the most popular payment method in the supermarket, the management should consider offering additional incentives, such as cashback to encourage even more customers to use this option. This could streamline transactions and improve customer satisfaction. The  supermarket should optimize  the tiime of the day the highest sales were recorded at 10:05 AM, indicating a peak shopping time. Consider running special promotions or increasing staffing during these peak hours to maximize revenue and improve customer experience. Additionally, Specific marketing  should be targeted to other city , With City 1 generating the most revenue, it would be beneficial to strengthen marketing efforts here and replicate successful strategies in City 2 and City 3.




Targeted campaigns could help increase sales in lower-performing cities. Specific gender campaign With males accounting for a slightly higher percentage of sales, consider tailoring marketing campaigns to this demographic, while also creating targeted promotions to encourage more shopping from female customers to balance the gender gap.




Credit card usage is slightly lower than other payment methods, offering rewards or loyalty points for credit card payments could encourage more customers to use this option as this will improve credit card usage.  Also,  electronic accessories and home & lifestyle products attract the highest discounts there should be more marketing efforts on these categories to increase bundles deals or upsell opportunities could increase overall sales. For the food and beverage category, which has the least discount, a price review strategy will increase the sales and also yield more profit.
